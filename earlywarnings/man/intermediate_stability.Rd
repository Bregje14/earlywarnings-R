\usage{
intermediate_stability(dat, meta, reference.point = NULL, method = "lm")
}
\arguments{
  \item{dat}{Input data matrix (variables x samples)}

  \item{meta}{Metadata (samples x factors). This should
  contain for each sample the following self-explanatory
  fields: subjectID and time.}

  \item{reference.point}{Calculate stability of the data
  w.r.t. this point.  By default the intermediate range is
  used (min + (max - min)/2)}

  \item{method}{"lm" (linear model) or "correlation"; the
  linear model takes time into account as a covariate}
}
\value{
A list with following elements: stability: vector listing
the intermediate stability for each variable data:
processed data sets used for calculations
}
\description{
Quantify stability with respect to a given reference point
for all variables.
}
\details{
This method decomposes the data set into differences
between consecutive time points. For each variable and time
point we calculate for the data values: (i) the distance
from reference point; (ii) distance from the data value at
the consecutive time point. The "correlation" method
calculates correlation between these two variables.
Negative correlations indicate that values closer to
reference point tend to have larger shifts in the
consecutive time point. The "lm" method takes the time lag
between the consecutive time points into account as this
may affect the comparison and is not taken into account by
the straightforward correlation. Here the coefficients of
the following linear model are used to assess stability:
abs(change) ~ time + abs(start.reference.distance)

\examples{
# Create simulated example data
  dat <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 10)
  rownames(dat) <- paste("Variable", 1:nrow(dat), sep = "")
  colnames(dat) <- paste("Sample", 1:ncol(dat), sep = "")
  meta <- data.frame(list(
    	  sampleID = colnames(dat),
  	  subjectID = rep(paste("subject", 1:50, sep = "-"), each = 2),
	  time = rep(1:2, 50)))
  # Intentionally make point very unstable around 0
  dat[1, meta$time == 2] <- 1/abs(dat[1, meta$time == 1])
  s <- intermediate_stability(dat, meta, reference.point = 0)
